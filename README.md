# Toy-maker-RAPID

This is the code for a simulated automated production of a toy with two ABB industrial robot manipulators (IRB 2600). It is in RAPID programming language. One robot is tasked with the actual assembly of the toy and when it is finished, the other takes over, takes the toy to its workspace, and paints a face on the toy. During the whole procedure, there are multiple times when the user is asked for inputs to modify the final result of the toy.

Here is a video of the final simulation and the functionality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XQYWjXlKPU
